1. **Assess and Improve:** this includes _Evaluation_ processes for your applications, _Tracing_ to debug your flows and _content filters_ to add guardrails to prompt inputs and completion outputs.
1. **My assets**: Here you can add additional elements to the project, with resources such as _Data_, _Indexes_, _Models and endpoints_ and _Web apps_ to be used as part of your work.
1. **Management Center:** a location to manage all you  hub and project details and resources.

## Data and indexes

In this lab we are going to provide models access to a set of private data, to test their ability to ground responses. In this step, let's add this data in our Azure AI project. 

Download the data on your machine from [this folder](https://github.com/microsoft/aitour-concept-to-creation-ai-studio/tree/main/src/data/products). For the sake of this lab, you don't need to download the whole list of files, pick the first 5 (from *product_info_1.md* to *product_info_5.md*) and save them into a folder named **product_catalog** on your Desktop.

1. Navigate to **Data + Indexes**
2. Select, **New data,** and select **Upload files/folders** as **Data source**
        ![Select your data](./Images/ai-foundry-select-data.png)
3. Open the **Upload files or folder** dropdown, select **Upload folder** and upload the files hosted in the **product_catalog** folder you just created.
        ![Upload folder](./Images/ai-foundry-upload-folder.png) 
4. Once data is uploaded, name your data as **contoso-products** and finish.
5. Next, in the same tab, navigate to _Indexes_ and create an index for your data.
   - Move to the **Indexes** tab in the _Data + Indexes_ page.
   - Click on the **+ New index** button.
   - Select **Data in Azure AI Foundry** as the data source and then the data source you just uploaded.
        ![Create Vector Index](./Images/ai-foundry-create-index.png)
